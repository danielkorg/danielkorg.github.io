Enjoy!

I will post some audio demos soon to demonstrate the greatness of this app!

This is just the very first, baseline, version. It will be improved!

-more apps coming soon!

UPCOMING FEATURES:

- any number of channels processing: mono, stereo or higher
- the app will no longer depend on spatial location from center/side separation, it will work regardless of the spatial position of the vocals
- I am trying to figure out also the reverb part, this might take a longer time
- I am also in the process of doing an improvement to get rid of sound effects, I already have an idea on how to do this, it requires a specially crafted VAD that I am working on with some additional post-processing
- allow additional inputs, mp3, flac, etc (maybe even from video files, but will see about this)
- trying to solve overlapping background vocals, that are meant for music and not primary vocals
- trying to solve cases where transient drums are still mixed in with the vocals, this can take some time
