**June 18, 2019 - - July/August release**

DVA v2 will be released either in July or August.
I want to improve it further and it will require some
additional time. Trying new methods and ideas.
Will post another update when I have a very good idea
of when it will be released. Thank you for being patient!

**January 19, 2019 - - Deep Vocal Attractor (DVA) v2.0**

v2 is coming soon! 

The first version was removed, too many bugs.
This upcoming version (v2) will be considered the new baseline version instead.

more info coming soon!
